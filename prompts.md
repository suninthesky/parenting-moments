I want to build a immersive game where you deal with challenging parenting situations with a young child. You have to quickly make choices in real-time to respond to the childs social, emotional, and learning needs. You lose the game if these needs go unmet for too long. Can you first write the readme.md? Let's make it simple and build one step at a time. Don't code yet.

## 2
Can you adjust the planned technical stack in the README.md to use something simpler than React and Redux? Could HTMX work? And if not, explain why React is the best choice.

## 3
Add a simpler-option.md outlining what a simpler game concept would look like using HTMX or a lighter framework. Also explain is Vue could be an viable option for both simple and more complex game concepts.

## 4
Update the planned technical stack in README.md to use Vue and related libraries as needed. Also explore how to make the HTMX option in simpler-option.md have real-time updates and features like a timer for decisions.

## 5
Add a development roadmap to simpler-option.md using the HTMX option. Let's make it simple and build one step at a time. Remove the Vue option. Don't code yet.

## 6
Incorporate the "Educational Features" into the plan so the game can build parenting confidence and skills.

## 7
Build Phase 1 of the development roadmap.

## 8 (context `/htmx-version`)
Update what we've built so far to use Tailwind CSS and Fastify for the server. Also update the Technical Implementation Notes in the README to reflect these choices as well as filling in the Server-Side Implementation Notes section.

## 9  (context `/htmx-version`)
Build phase 2 of the development roadmap in README.md. Also add nodemon (or similar best practice library) for auto reloading and running multiple commands during development. Update styles in server.js to use Tailwind if needed.

## 10 (context `/htmx-version`)
Resolve the "Method 'HEAD' already declared for route" FastifyError.

## 11 (context `/htmx-version`)
Use express instead of fastify for the server. Ensure requests and responses work with HTMX and its hx-post method sending JSON. Update dependencies accordingly.

## 12 (context `/htmx-version`)
Build phase 3 of the development roadmap in README.md. Ensure the hx-vals approach of sending data is retained. Make the visual feedback immersive. 

## 13 (context `/htmx-version`)
Remove the Score section from index.html and any associated logic - focus more on the status bars. When the timer for the current situation runs out this should impact the childs status untill an option is selected. Turn the timer into a progress bar that changes colour as it depletes and spans the top of the current situation card. Only reveal the parenting tip after half of the time has passed. After selecting an option the current situation section should be replaced with section for the next scenario. Extract the JavaScript in index.html into a seperate file.

## 14 (context `/htmx-version`)
Almost there. Integrate the Parenting Tip into the card for the Current Situation. When an option is selected replace the whole Current Situation card with information about the outcome on the childs social, emotional, and learning needs, and a button to load the next scenario. When the timer for the current situation runs out change the background of the timer bar to red, with a short notice in the center of the bar explaining the childs patience is lowering. Consider revising or removing the '/timeout' endpoint on the server if needed.

## 15 (context `/vue-version`)
Build phase 1 of the Development Roadmap from the README.md. Make the most of the capabilities of Phaser.js.

## 16 (context `/htmx-version`)
Build Phase 4 of the Development Roadmap from the README.md. Ensure code quality and refactor things needed. You can skip the tutorial and achievement system for now, and focus more on quality scenarios that build parenting capabilities informed by evidence-based guidance. Optimise the UI/UX for a mobile device.

## 17 (context `/htmx-version`)
You've introduced breaking changes, the initial scenario is not loaded - resolve this and ensure the user can successfully complete at least three scenarios in a row. To verify this write some automated tests - consider using Playwright for end-to-end tests (or another best practice tool but provide a reason if choosing something else).

## 18 (context `/htmx-version`)
The third scenario in scenarios.js is not consistent with the others an causing an error - update it. Also combine social, emotional and learning impact attributes into a single attribute about 'social and emotional learning'. Be sure to update the server and client files accordingly. Finally add several more scenarios.

## 19 (context `/htmx-version`)
Lets update the user journey. The landing/start page should be a mobile optimsed page with: 1) a short engaging title and tagline - focus on the value proposition for users; 2) a start button which takes the user to the first scenario; 3) after the final scenario the user should be presented with a result page summarising their choices and focusing on actionable guidance to improve their parenting skills. Update and add files as needed, and refactor, organise or remove uneccesary code. Explore saving state on the client if needed.

## 20 (context `/htmx-version`)
You've lost the child and parent status bars, as well as scenerio timer from the scenario component. Make sure to retain these features. Look at previous versions, and game.js - which you may want to remove and integrate elements into app.js. Also integrate the status and timer bars visually into the existing mobile optimised UI.

## 21 (context `/htmx-version`)
You've visually integrated the status and timer bars but they don't function as expected. For instance the child and parent bars don't change accordingly when an option is selected, nor does the timer bar reduce. In the browser console we are also seeing errors related to documnt.body and window.parentingApp being undefined as well as timerInterval being redeclared - we may need to wrap code in a dom ready function or similar best practice. Debug and resolve these issues and explain your choices.

## 22 (context `/htmx-version`)
That looks broadly okay, but I think you forgot example config files, like package.json, vite.config.ts, and tailwind.config.js. Update the plan to include these.

## 23 (context `/vue-version`)
The CJS build of Vite's Node API is deprecated, update config files to resolve this.

## 24
Add a README.md to outline the original concept and requirements, and the fact this was a vibe coding experiment. Integrate this prompts.md file into the readme to show the development process. Conclude the readme by briefly summarising the code, architecture and implementation in /htmx-version and /vue-version. Also explain that a demo of the /vue-version is served via GitHub Pages from the /docs folder.
