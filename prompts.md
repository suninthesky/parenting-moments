I want to build a immersive game where you deal with challenging parenting situations with a young child. You have to quickly make choices in real-time to respond to the childs social, emotional, and learning needs. You lose the game if these needs go unmet for too long. Can you first write the readme.md? Let's make it simple and build one step at a time. Don't code yet.

## 2
Can you adjust the planned technical stack in the README.md to use something simpler than React and Redux? Could HTMX work? And if not, explain why React is the best choice.

## 3
Add a simpler-option.md outlining what a simpler game concept would look like using HTMX or a lighter framework. Also explain is Vue could be an viable option for both simple and more complex game concepts.

## 4
Update the planned technical stack in README.md to use Vue and related libraries as needed. Also explore how to make the HTMX option in simpler-option.md have real-time updates and features like a timer for decisions.

## 5
Add a development roadmap to simpler-option.md using the HTMX option. Let's make it simple and build one step at a time. Remove the Vue option. Don't code yet.

## 6
Incorporate the "Educational Features" into the plan so the game can build parenting confidence and skills.
