# Parenting Simulator: Real-Time Child Care Challenge

An immersive game where players navigate the complex world of parenting by making real-time decisions to meet a child's social, emotional, and learning needs.

## Game Concept

In this simulation game, players take on the role of a parent caring for a young child. The game presents various challenging situations that require quick thinking and appropriate responses. Players must balance multiple needs while managing their own resources and patience.

### Core Mechanics

- **Real-time Decision Making**: Players must respond quickly to situations as they arise
- **Multiple Needs System**: Track and manage the child's:
  - Social needs (interaction, attention)
  - Emotional needs (comfort, security)
  - Learning needs (stimulation, education)
- **Resource Management**: Players have limited energy and patience
- **Consequence System**: Choices have immediate and long-term effects on the child's development

### Game Features

- Dynamic scenarios that evolve based on player choices
- Real-time needs monitoring system
- Multiple difficulty levels
- Progressive challenges as the child grows
- Feedback system showing the impact of decisions
- Achievement system for successful parenting strategies

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Mechanics
- Basic needs tracking system
- Simple decision-making interface
- Basic scenario implementation
- Core game loop

### Phase 2: Content Expansion
- Additional scenarios
- More complex decision trees
- Enhanced feedback system
- Basic visual representation

### Phase 3: Polish & Enhancement
- Improved UI/UX
- Sound effects and music
- Tutorial system
- Performance optimization

## Technical Stack (Planned)

### Frontend
- **Vue 3/TypeScript**: Chosen for its progressive framework approach and excellent performance:
  - Composition API for flexible and maintainable code
  - Built-in reactivity system
  - Smaller bundle size than React
  - Strong TypeScript integration
  - Easy learning curve

### Game Engine
- **Phaser.js**: A powerful HTML5 game framework that provides:
  - Physics engine for game mechanics
  - Sprite and animation management
  - Input handling
  - Asset loading and management

### State Management
- **Pinia**: Vue's official state management solution offering:
  - Simple and intuitive API
  - DevTools support
  - TypeScript support
  - Modular stores for different game aspects
  - Better performance than Vuex

### Styling & Animation
- **Tailwind CSS**: For rapid UI development and responsive design
- **Vue Transitions**: Built-in transition system for smooth animations
- **GSAP**: For complex animations and timelines when needed

### Why This Stack?
This combination provides an optimal balance of power and simplicity while maintaining excellent performance:
- Progressive framework that can start simple and scale
- Excellent developer experience
- Strong TypeScript support
- Rich ecosystem of game development tools
- Efficient state management
- Smooth animations and transitions
